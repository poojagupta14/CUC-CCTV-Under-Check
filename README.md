# CUC
Detecting major changes and anomalies in a real time CCTV frame.

# Yolo algorithm is used for the real time detection.

# Project description:

Most of the time CCTVs are used at post-event for the verification of any incident. This project will equip CCTV as a pre-event tool. This project is to avoid any unwanted event by creating a pre-event warning whenever there are anomalies in the CCTV frame.
